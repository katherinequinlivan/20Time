		Why Cybersecurity??
	</h2>

<div class = "paragraph">

	<h5> The security and safety of our lives is constantly threatened by online dangers. This is an growing issue in our lives today, so it needs a solution. I am also very interested in computer science, so I couldn't help but try to spread the word of cyber crime and safety through my own coded webpage.
	</h5>

	<h5> For this project I intervied Mr. Roche who is the St. Mark's school computer science teacher and has had many jobs and taken many classes revolving the topic. I also interviewed my dad Mark Quinlivan, CEO and fonder of Confer Technologies. He went to college for computer science and has run may companies that have worked with computers and phones. I thought that both of these people would be amazing mentors for this project becuase of there immense amount of knowlege and work in these topics. 
	</h5>

	<h5> Along with the help of many online sources, I have also gathered most of my information from my two mentors after having a very informational interview with both of them. What I learned from those intervies very much went into the making of this page, and there is scattered information from both of them throughout this website
