		Why Cybersecurity??
	</h2>

	<h3> The security and safety of our lives is constantly threatened by online dangers. This is an growing issue in our lives today, so it needs a solution. I am also very interested in computer science, so I couldn't help but try to spread the word of cyber crime and safety through my own coded webpage/blog.
