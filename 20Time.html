		The 20Time project was created to encourage their employes to spend 20 percent of their time working at google, working on a project a their choice. This created some of their biggest projects such as gmail and google maps.

		For my project, I am mainly revolving it around cybersecurity. I have included information of the many threats and dangers online, along with tips and tricks to keep you safe.

		I have benefited so much from this project, becuase in building a website it has helped me further my understanding on how computers and webpages work. Which has ultimately helped me understand what makes a safe and secure website, and how people can be attacked online.
