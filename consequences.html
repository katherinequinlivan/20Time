	<h3>
		There are many horrible consequences to getting a virus, hacked, etc. These most often include: becoming a victim of identity theft, fraud, loss of personal information, and theft from bank accounts. Most cybercriminals main goal is to steal money, so if this includes hacking personal passwords and accounts, that won't stop them. Spam alone can cost you lots of money, time, and safety. By not taking reasonable precautions, you could face all of these consequences.
